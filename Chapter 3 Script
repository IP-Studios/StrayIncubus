    z "Hm?"

    #Z asks why the guards have no weapons, the prince makes them demonstrate their powerful af magic saying that elves are specialists in magic.
    #The don't have weapons, they can conjure them with magic, they also heavily rely on magic.
    #The prince brags about how he provided well paying jobs for the goblins and helped civilise them. Gives some credits to illya.
    #The prince says he'll also lend them a dozen of his personal gaurd when they leave to the nearby villages and says he doesn't understand why his daughter wants to visit these peasants.
    #Z (with centoria) gets a mission to protect the princess of Centoria's vilage of some sort. Her father specifies that he's not to be further than 1 meter away outside of the city and can be instructed to be up to 20
    #meters away inside the city.
    #A magic bond is formed by a sorceress working in the castle.
    #The sorceress who works for the prince is a hooded figure who never shows any part of her skin (She's a goblin!)
    #The prince tells them that local goblins recently attacked the elf city a few times and the princess insists on visiting the outskirts of the city as a part of her birthweek celebrations like she always does. A body guard is needed for the princess.
    #The sorceress made Illya a talking snow man.

#13) Intimate situations with Yumi:
    #Yumi has to apply a potion from gabbie and venus to heal up properly. Z has to apply it when Centoria isn't around leading to sexual stuff.


#14) Fencing tournament:
    #In the fencing tourny (no magic is allowed) Z is asked to compete by the princess.
    #Vollstahl, the king's personal gaurd, wins againts Z. Vollstahl is a short man, who always wears an full armour and a helmet covering all of his body. (He's actually a goblin who betrays the elves later on and joins axius).
    #The winner is decided by who stops just before hitting their opponent. Vollstahl is very respectful towards Z after winning.
    #Before beating Z Vollstahl totally destroys Yumi.
    #Z wins sth for second place.

#15) Magic tournament:
    #Illya is in Z's team (boding between them)
    #The elves are absurdly strong in magic.

#16) Illusion tournament:
    #The sorceress who's fully covered puts them into an illusion they need to escape.
    #Illya is again in Z's team (boding between them)

#17) Taking a bath with Illya and Centoria:
    #Since he can't be far from her, they all take a bath together.

#18) Goblin tournament:
    #This whole thing was suggested by Illya's father. She doesn't like the idea because it establishes that the goblins are beneath the elves and that they should transform.
    #There is an event for goblins, who ever wins gets a potion that transorms them into elves.
    #Z is surprised that such a potion exists. The elves explain that the and the goblins have a common ancestory and with a powerful potion you can accend to an elf as a goblin but the potion is very expensive. 

#19) Illya's plan:
    #Later to Z's team alone after playing together in the tournament and bonding with them.

    illya "I'm not an idiot. I know it'll create dozens of problems."
    illya "But I'd rather have to solve those than have the pointless conflict that we have right now."
    illya "And in a decade or two, we will have gotten used to each other."
    illya "It'll take time and effort. But we can do it."
    illya "It is the best solution."
    z "I don't think your father will agree to it, do you?"

    ymi "I will."
    z "Princess, you'll keep your face hidden and dress like a handmaiden to hide your identity."
    illya "Okay, b-"
    z "And I also want the two goblins I saw working outside the caslte to come with us."
    illya "Eh?"
    illya "Explain."
    z "They're a sign of good faith. If the goblins see their own walking with the princess, they might get the imrpression that we come peacefully and that goblins and elves can cooperate."
    illya "I see, I see..."
    illya "Not a bad idea at all."
    illya "Anything else?"
    z "Yes. Carry a weapon. A knife or something you can hide in your clothes."

    Dohkong "Ahahah... So I'm your enemy? That's sad to hear."
    z "You wouldn't say that the elves and the goblins are enemies?"
    Dohkong "Sadly, the realistic answer is probably yes, they are enemies."
    z "Sadly? The goblins are the ones who have been attacking and raiding the elven city!"
    Dohkong "Did I attack or raid anyone? For the record I very much disagree with doing that."
    Dohkong "Sadly... The pale goblin has been distant lately... Listening to her new advisor, who's been advising her to attack the elves every chance they get..."
    Dohkong "But it's not really up to me. Is it up to you that the goblins born for workers inside the elven city are given potions to transform into elves?"
    z "What?"
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "I guess I can't expect you to know much about that? Doesn't affect you after all, does it?"

    Dohkong "But..."

    nxi "They also suffered a great injustice at the hands of these elves."
    z "Does that justify killing innocent elves?"
    nxi "Does it matter if it justifies it?"
    nxi "That's the only way they can hurt the elves, isn't it?"
    nxi "I'm pretty sure that's all the goblins care about."
    nxi "Plus, do you actually think in a war of a goblin army against the elven army the goblins stood a chance until now?"
    z "Until now?"
    nxi "..."
    z "Wait..."
    z "You don't mean..."
    z "You want my help?"
    nxi "I don't want it..."
    nxi "I need it."
    nxi "A minotaur and a demi-god fighting with the goblins, and we might start looking like a winning side."
    nxi "The elves haven't had a war in centuries."
    nxi "Their warriors are not seasoned. Their army is not disciplined. Not a single elven soldier today has been withen a mile of a battle."
    nxi "The pale goblin has been pushing for an all out attack for weeks now."
    nxi "I've convinced her to wait for the right time. And she's listening for now, but not for long."
    nxi "I told you. I don't want to massacre any of the two sides. But if we can overwhelm them quickly enough, the death toll will be minimised."
    z "You're going to attack them..."
    nxi "Eventually, yes. With or without you, I'm afraid."
    z "So if I say no to joining you, you-"
    nxi "I told you. I don't want to kill you."
    nxi "I'll just keep you here. If you'd help the elves, that's a problem for us."
    z "My friends are still in the elven city."
    nxi "..."
    nxi "I trust you know I can't do anything about that... If I send them a warning, the elves will know we're comming. And surprise on our side is something we can't throw away."

    z "Wel-"
    Character("????") "Tsk. Tsk. Tsk..."
    Character("????") "Quite good at putting yourself is situations like these, aren't you..."
    #Gets really close to him.
    Character("????") "You have lots to do for me..."
    Character("????") "I can't have you rotting away in a place like this..."
    Character("????") "Wouldn't you agree?"
    #It's Seria behind her.
    z "Seira?"
    s "[mc_name]..."
    #Z wakes up.
    #It's morning.
    Dohkong "..." #She's bringing him food.
    z "..."
    z "Dohkong..."
    z "Are you okay?"
    Dohkong "Yeah... It could've been much worse..."
    Dohkong "He would've killed me..."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "You stopped him didn't you?"
    z "Yeah..."
    Dohkong "Why?"
    Dohkong "Your chances of escaping would've been better if you let him finish the job."
    z "I'm not a murderer Dohkong."
    Dohkong "Even if it meant you being instead of running free?"
    z "You guys can't hold me forever."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "I had hoped that Herra and Sye would've come to see me as a friend..."
    z "..."
    z "I'm sorry..."
    Dohkong "Say..."
    Dohkong "When we first met you said we were enemies you and me, didn't you?"
    Dohkong "Is there anything I can do to make you change your mind?"
    z "..."
    z "I..."
    z "I don't think that you and I are enemies, Dohkong..."
    z "I was assigned to protect the princess from the goblins who almost killed her. So the goblins were my enemies."
    z "But I have nothing against you personally."
    z "I actually like you. That's why I saved your life, remember?"
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "I see..."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "My instructions were to only free one of your hands to you can eat and only after leaving your cell."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "But..."
    #Frees all his limbs.
    z "..."
    Dohkong "I can't let the man who saved my life struggle through eating his breakfast, can I?"
    z "Thanks..."
    #Sits down and eats.
    Dohkong "I'm sorry... I know we don't cook great food..."
    z "No, no. Don't worry about it... I've had worse..."
    z "What am I eating exactly?"
    Dohkong "How do you call that creature in your language..."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "Skeever! That's it!"
    Dohkong "It's skeever stew basically..."
    z "..." #Stops eating.
    #Puts the bowl down.
    z "I see..."
    Dohkong "So will you tell me now what you're doing here?"
    Dohkong "Nixie said you're a ninja. Is it true?"
    z "Yeah."
    Dohkong "Why would you protect the princess?"
    z "I guess there's no point in not telling you... Nixie probably knows everything anyway."
    z "I was hired to protect her on her birth week."
    Dohkong "Why? Doesn't she have the royal guard for that?"
    z "The princess asked for us instead of the royal guard because she wanted to go against her father's wishes by bringing a peace agreement to the goblins."
    z "And the royal guard would've reported her plan to the crowned prince."
    Dohkong "Oh..."
    Dohkong "She really wanted to make us citizens?"
    z "Yeah..."
    Dohkong "I see..."
    z "Would you like that?"
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "I don't..."
    Dohkong "No... I don't think so..."
    z "How come?"
    Dohkong "I actually do like it here..."
    Dohkong "And I don't honestly think we'll ever be treated equally in there..."
    Dohkong "I've lived in the city for years... I know the way elves look at me every time I walk around in their streets..."
    z "..."
    z "I see..."
    Dohkong "But I guess there are also elves like you..."
    Dohkong "And like Illya..."
    z "..."
    z "I'm not actually an elf, Dohkong."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "Eh?!"
    z "I'm an incubus."
    z "Same as Nixie. But, well... Male."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "Do you ever have a hard time because of it?"
    Dohkong "Being who you are?"
    z "Well, maybe a bit..."
    z "There was this one woman in the ninja village who was wary of me for a while."
    z "Ultimately though, she warmed up to me, I guess."
    Dohkong "..."
    Dohkong "Do you think that would happen if the princess's plan succeeds?"
    z "Maybe..."
    z "I can't say for sure..."
    Dohkong "..."

    Character("Big woman") "I see..."

    Character("Big woman") "..."

    Character("Big woman") "Nah."

    jillia "Then came a winged big man with two horns."
    z "..."
    z "Axius?"
    jillia "Aye."
    jillia "He offered to buy him."
    jillia "Alive."
    jillia "Took him away as I watched behind my mother's leg."
    jillia "Then he stopped. Turned around and looked me right in the eye."
    jillia "Then said he'd buy me for twice what he paid for my brother."
    jillia "I didn't even think my mother would consider it."
    jillia "Then she asked for three times as much."
    jillia "He nodded."
    z "..."
    jillia "He shot my brother with half a dozen potions."

    z "..."
    z "So you are a slave?"
    jillia "You can call it that..."
    jillia "But if I had to a say in it, I'd still choose lord Axius."
    z "Why?"
    jillia "Because I have a place to belong to."
    jillia "It's home."
    jillia "I wouldn't want to be a stray."
    jillia "And my brother wouldn't survive without his potions."
    jillia "We need Axius more than he needs us."

    #They specifically asked for Z after hearing about his exploits.
    #They also ask for Centoria.
    #Yumi, Zycris, and Centoria are sent.

    #The Celebration with for the princess's birthday include several tournoments in which Z competes.
    #When they get to the elf village, the tournoments have already begun.
    #In the fencing tourny (no magic is allowed) Z is asked to compete by the princess.
    #Vollstahl, the king's personal gaurd, wins againts Z. Vollstahl is a short man, who always wears an full armour and a helmet covering all of his body. (He's actually a goblin who betrays the elves later on and joins axius).
    #The winner is decided by who stops just before hitting their opponent. Vollstahl is very respectful towards Z after winning.
    #Before beating Z Vollstahl totally destroys Yumi.
    #More games where the princess competes with Z giving them more time to build a friendship.	
    #Many goblins work in the elf city in low paying jobs that the elves wouldn't do.
    #Elves have strong magic that they always use.

    #When Z leaves the city, he sees goblins going in at the gates having their work permits checked.
    #Z's party is ambushed by a bunch of goblins and two minatours, the two goblins are shockingly killed immediately. He manages to draw the goblins away from the princess and tells them to run back to the city. Z is captured though using magic sealing spells by the goblins.

    #In the dungeon, he meets elves being improsined there (one woman is pregnant with her husband).
    #The pregnant elf tells Z she's about to give birth and she doesn't want her child to grow up in captivity.
    #The guard (a goblin) is nice to the prisoners. Z is surprised she speaks his language. She says her parents worked for years in the elf city.
    #Z takes the chance to talk to her, she tells him the place where the elves built their city belonged to the goblins.
    #They were driven away according to her and many of them died while fighting the elves. Z tells her it's still not right to attack the elves killing innocents. She says she didn't make that decision.
    #She says the pale goblin has a new advisor who advised him to do the attacks.
    #Z wakes up to the elf woman giving birth. She begs the gaurd to help her deliver the baby. The gaurd hesitantly accepts. The gaurd helps her, the husband tries to kill the gaurd while she's occupied with the birth.
    #Z stops him but the gaurd is knocked out.
    #Z asks him wtf he just tried to do, the husband says they have to escape and it was the only way.
    #The guard wakes up and sounds the alarm. They are surrouned by goblins with no magic, Z fights off the goblins with his bare hands while the others escape.

    #Z is taken directly before the pale goblin. On his side is Nixie.
    #The minatour from chapter 3 and a new minatour woman is also there.
    #Z notices the old minatour.
    #Nixie translates for him.
    #Nixie tells him that even though she works for axius and she does plenty of evil. The goblins are in the right here.
    #Z tells the pale goblin that many goblins work in the elven city and have good jobs.
    #The pale goblin calls them traitors. And says they only get the jobs that are at the foot of the economy anyway.
    #Z the pale goblin what his plan is. The pale goblin tells him he'll kill all the elves.

    #&&&&&&&&MORE DETAILS&&&&&&&&&&&&
    #Nixie visits asking him what he plans to do now.
    #She says she doesn't trust him yet, so that's why she can't risk him escaping to use his magic.
    #She says she knows from the others that she can't kill him normally cuz he'll regenerate. And she says she doesn't want to kill him.

#Dev log:
#We'll be meeting some new characters that will probably stick with us for a while. The conflict between the now more powerful Axius & the ninja village will start to to spark.
